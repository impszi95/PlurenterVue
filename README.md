## General info
It's becomming more and more difficult to find good tenants for landlords. On a traditional renting website, you get
 a ton of tenant requests, which results a bunch of time consuming on-side interviews by the time you filtering out the 
 right person, whom you are willing to rent your apartment.<br /><br />
With Plurenter you can filter tenants and view their profile before get contacted, that helps you save time by contacting 
with the tenants who already fits for your requirements. The base matching procedure is similar to Tinder's.

## Features
Users can upload their images and fill their personal and filtering datas depending on whether she is a tenant or a landlord.<br />
